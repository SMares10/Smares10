# Hola! I'm Steve

I'm an Electronics Industrial Engineer with 20+ years of experience in Aerospace Quality, Hardware Testing, Manufacturing Engineering and working on becoming a Web Developer.

Take the suit away and what am I? husband, father, soccer player, car mechanic, gamer and huge geek!

My way of living is: Respect all life and be happy.
